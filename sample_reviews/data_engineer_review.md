Great instinct. For a first‑time audience, it *does* help to show a version that’s clearly “raw notes → polished review.” You can keep it realistic by framing the sloppy text as **pre‑HR draft notes pasted from personal docs/Slack**. That’s common in the wild and won’t feel contrived.

Below is an **“intentionally messy but plausible”** self‑review for a **Data Engineer** (H1 2025). It preserves the same facts/metrics as the earlier version so your **summarizer** and **key‑highlights extractor** still shine—while giving the **rationalizer** plenty to fix.

## Data Engineer Self‑Review — *Raw Draft (intentionally sloppy)*

**role**: data engineer (IC / sorta TechLead sometimes)
**period**: Q1–Q2 / H1 2025
teams touched: data platform, SRE, payments, ML platform, mktg DS, finance, legal/sec

so… this half I mostly lived inside the checkout data pipeline. we had this old nightly batch ETL (slow + flaky + \$\$\$). pushed it to an **incrememntal** CDC flow (Debezium + Kafka). main Airflow DAG used to take **7 h 20 m** (sometimes worse), now it’s **1h05m** end‑to‑end when green. freshness SLA from **24h → 2h** which finally unblocked mktg analytics + finance recs. brought down **p95** job failures from **3.8%** to **0.6%** after sane retries + moved a couple long queries to Presto with a saner partitioning strategy. S3 storage cost is down **\$18.7k/month** (object pruning, deleted stale intermediates, lifecycle → Glacier @ 90d). I know I’ve said this in standups but there was a lot of yak‑shaving/backfills so calling it out again.

data quality: rolled out Great Expectations (maybe **over‑zealously** at first). added **186 tests** across \~top 30 tables; test coverage **22% → 81%** for “priority” datasets. incidents from bad partitions/missing cols fell **11 → 3** / month and MTTR **4h12m → 1h08m** after we wrote fix playbooks. still had a few Friday pages while on‑call (sorry SRE). they also helped harden Airflow workers—thanks team!

ml side: built small **feast**‑based feature store (ya we debated buy vs build). goal was de‑risking online features for realtime offers. materialization + Redis online store got feature compute latency from **14m** to **2m** avg. offline/online consistency errors **‑72%** after standardizing feature views + data contracts. we have **3** prod models on it now (churn, LTV, promos ranking). marketing claims **+3.2%** conversion uplift for promo eligibility once features stabilized (their metric). partnered w/ ML platform for CI on feature defs + w/ Fraud on sanity checks.

infra/cost: tuned **Trino** autoscaling (and some coordinator GC). query cost **‑28%** vs prior baseline; cluster hours **3,120 → 2,250** over last 8 wks. S3 I/O **‑19%** (repartitioning + predicate pushdown). finance stopped asking why every query vacuumed “the whole lake”, which was nice. not 100% happy with queu(e)ing under spiky loads but better.

compliance: wrote GDPR delete pipeline (no consistent end‑to‑end path before). avg completion time **48h → 6h** using batched tombstones + idempotent path. partnered with Legal & Sec. we passed SOC2 Type II with **0 data retention exceptions** in my areas. also added S3 lifecycle rules (30‑day → cheaper storage) saving **\$4.6k/month** on historical logs.

team/process: mentored **2** interns + **2** new hires; onboarding docs need fewer “call me” pings now. wrote dbt style guide + PR template. build breakages from test name collisions down **‑43%** (rough estimate but CI is calmer). packaged a tiny **Airflow operator** library (templated S3 → Trino → dbt refresh) so ppl don’t c/p boilerplate; new DAG dev time **3 days → 1 day** and **12 teams** using it. I’m not a manager but tried to act as TechLead when cross‑team work needed.

things that didn’t go to plan: underestimated CDC backfills (also spammed SRE metrics—oops). first GE suites too strict → false positives, loosened later. for H2 2025 want to automate lineage impact so schema changes don’t crater downstream, and move to error budgets for freshness (teh pager fatigue is real). also **recieved** feedback to publish design docs earlier, will do (definately).
