  Where the main module code is
glob: "**/*.py"

The main modules are always under the src/ sub-directory of the project-root, and never directly under the project-root dir.

**Carefully note this down, so that you do not create code with imports like this: "import src.some_module..." . Instead you do "import some_module..."
