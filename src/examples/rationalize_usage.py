def rationalize_data_engineer_review() -> CopyEditedText:
    """Rationalize the sample data engineer self-review using TextModifiers.

    This function demonstrates the text rationalization capability by processing
    a raw, intentionally messy self-review that contains typical issues found
    in employee self-reviews pasted from personal docs or Slack:
    
    - Spelling errors and typos
    - Inconsistent formatting and punctuation
    - Casual shorthand and informal language
    - Grammar issues and inconsistent capitalization
    
    The rationalization process will clean up these issues while preserving
    the original meaning, structure, and all numerical data.

    Returns:
        CopyEditedText: Structured result containing the rationalized text,
                       token count, and whether changes were made.
